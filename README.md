# VTech DOS BASIC 1.2 

Laser 210/VZ200 Disk Operating System Disassembly and docs.

Heavly commented with intention to make everyone not only see the source code but also to understand how this code works and what concept was used by developers.

Source code is written in Z80 Assembly Language. Can be assembled back to exact original binary (raw binary format) using SjASMPlus Z80 Macro Assembler.
