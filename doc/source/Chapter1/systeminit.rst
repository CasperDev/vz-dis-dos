

System initialization
=====================


After successful installation, turn on your computer as usual.

The computer's initialization routine automatically recognizes that a floppy disk
system is connected and briefly starts the motor of the drive connected to "D1". The
read/write head is positioned on track 0 (that's the clicking noise).

The text "BASIC V2.0" or "BASIC V1.2"

is replaced by the text “DOS BASIC V1.0”

This is your sure sign that your diskette drive system is initialized.

You now have the additional :ref:`17 diskette editing commands <DOS commands>` mentioned above.

Of course, this does not happen if you have not connected any additional memory
expansion via a LASER 110 or VZ200.

Instead, the message appears there

	**?INSUFFICIENT MEMORY FOR DOS**

You can work with your computer as before, but you have no way of accessing the
floppy disk.
