===============

In order to understand and see through something, solid basic knowledge is 
essential. Only then will you be able to recognize connections and use them
correctly.

This principle also applies - or even more so - to the use of a floppy disk
systems on a home computer, which one can assume is not the first
line was procured for commercial purposes, but primarily to accommodate a hobby
to indulge in or to get further training in the field of data processing.
This book deals specifically with the connection of a floppy disk system
to a LASER 110, 210, 310 or Ðµven VZ200.

It describes in detail the basics and structure of the system and deals with
detailed with the possibilities of the supplied disk drive system (Disk
Operating System = DOS).

It is intended for all floppy disk users, whether they are new to computers or more
experienced "Freak",

In the first chapters, the basics are presented and the use within the available BASIC
language is described. Then they follow byte (partially bit) precise description of the
data organization on the diskette and a detailed explanation of the diskette
possibilities for assembler and machine program - experts.

However, don't let this put you off if this is your first time using a diskette. The
structure of this book allows step-by-step climbing into matter.
After studying the basics, start using the common DOS instructions and the
program/file management by first only using the floppy disk and use it as a storage
medium for your programs.

If you are sure about this, try using your own data from BASIC programs on the
disk and then process it again.

You should only turn to the last two chapters if the DOS application in BASIC is
completely familiar to you and you have some basic knowledge of the Z80
Assembler and machine language programming skills.
