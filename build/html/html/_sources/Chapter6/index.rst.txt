6. Application example 
======================

The "Address Management" program shown on the following pages shows a typical
application example for diskette processing with the LASER-DOS.

It allows the entry, storage and editing of up to 100 addresses.

The addresses are stored on the diskette in a "MAILBOX" file.

The processing procedure was selected with regard to the weaknesses of DOS
BASIC 1.0 in such a way that when the program starts the file content is read
completely into the memory and at the end of the processing it is written back
completely to the diskette due to changes.
