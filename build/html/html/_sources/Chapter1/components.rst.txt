The floppy disk drive **LASER DD20** was specially designed for
one of developed LASER computers 110, 210 and 310; However, it is suitable
also for the VZ200. These floppy disk drives are not compatible with others
computer systems (e.g. the LASER 2001 or LASER 30000 etc). Conversely, 
other floppy disk drives are also not suitable for these computers.

The connection to the computers is established with the help of a floppy disk
controller (Floppy Disk Controller) **LASER DI40**, which is connected to the System
Bus off of the computers and a memory expansion can be plugged into the
"piggyback" (Figure 1.1).

Two drives can be connected to a floppy disk controller at the same time to
operate. The floppy disk controler also contains the necessary system programs
extension (Disk Operating System = DOS)

On the LASER 110 computer and on the VZ200 with internal 4K-RAM there is required
an additional memory expansion of at least 16K.
